                <h3>Cleaning</h3>
                <p>After your event has finished you are expected to clean and tidy the clubhouse and bar (i.e. hoover and take away rubbish, if large volumes), as well as returning any furniture that has been moved to the original positions.</p>

                <h3>Responsible Person</h3>
                <p>During the event there needs to be a recognised person who is responsible for the running of the event and ensuring the clubhouse and bar are not mistreated.</p>

                <h3>Usage of the Bar</h3>
                <div class="note-box">
                    <p>Please remember that if you require the bar to be open then you (the requestor) are responsible for providing someone to run the bar for the duration of your event. These people need to be <strong>at least 18 years old</strong> and have received the <strong>bar/till induction/training</strong>.</p>

                <h3>Temporary Event Notice (Late Licence)</h3>
                <p>Usual clubhouse/bar licensed opening hours are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Monday to Saturday:</strong> 11am - 11pm</li>
                    <li><strong>Sunday:</strong> 12pm - 10:30pm</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is possible to request extensions to these times but you need to request (and have approved) a Temporary Event Notice (TEN) from the City Council. More details about the TEN can be found here: <a href="https://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/business/licensing/alcohol-licensing/temporary-event-notices/" target="_blank">Chelmsford City Council - Temporary Event Notices</a>. This is the responsibility of the requestor to organise, as well as to cover the cost of the licence (<strong>¬£21</strong>).</p>
